<h1>14 cited for fireworks infractions in Ajax, Ont., over Canada Day weekend</h1>
<p>In the aftermath of the Canada Day long weekend, the Town of Ajax has laid charges against 14 individuals alleged to have violated the fireworks bylaw  and issued several warnings.


    “What we have been noticing over the last year…[is] the amount of community individuals that have been going into our town park system [and] setting off fireworks…especially [after] COVID-19,” Derek Hannan, manager of bylaw for the Town of Ajax, said.
    Over the long weekend, the town received reports of infractions ranging from illegal fireworks displays in public parks to litter and property damage left behind by revellers.
    
    “The trend thats been increasing is…community fireworks based on groups of families within an area,” Hannan said. “[Groups are] going to parks, park[ing] at screen spaces, school fields…and igniting a large number of fireworks.”
    Bylaw officers patrolled town parks and greenspaces between June 30 and July 2, from 9 p.m. until midnight. The effort resulted in several pre-emptive warnings issued to potential offenders, discouraging the unauthorized use of fireworks.</p>
